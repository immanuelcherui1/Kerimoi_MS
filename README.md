# ABOUT KFMS

"I am currently developing the 'Kerimoi Farmers Management System,' an ongoing software project aimed at optimizing operations for agricultural societies. This system facilitates daily recording of milk deliveries from farmers, tracks inventory for society stores selling farm produce, and analyzes market demand trends. Additional features include payment calculation for farmers, route optimization for milk collection, and quality assurance checks. It also offers a mobile app for farmers to input deliveries and access resources. Designed for scalability and customization, this project aims to empower agricultural societies to enhance productivity, profitability, and sustainability. I am actively working on this project, contributing to its development and refinement."
